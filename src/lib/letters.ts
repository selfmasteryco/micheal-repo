I respectfully request that you conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of each item above as required under FCRA Section 1681i. If any item cannot be fully verified with the original furnisher, it must be promptly deleted or corrected, and an updated copy of my credit report must be provided to me.

RE: Formal Dispute -- ${creditor} | ${bureau.name}

To Whom It May Concern,

I am asserting my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. Section 1681 et seq. I am not utilizing any credit repair organization as defined under the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA), 15 U.S.C. Section 1679. I composed and submitted this letter myself. I am aware that no law requires me to provide a power of attorney or to prove personal authorship in order to submit a consumer dispute.

Under the FCRA and the Metro 2 data field reporting standards established by the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA), all furnished information must be accurate, complete, and verifiable at the time of reporting. Any deviation from these standards jeopardizes the integrity of the data and my rights as a consumer.

INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS (15 U.S.C. Section 1681i)

I respectfully demand that you:

  1. Confirm receipt of this dispute in writing within 14 business days.
  2. Complete a thorough reinvestigation within 30 days of receipt.

NOTICE REGARDING FORM LETTER RESPONSES
${SEP}

I am aware that bureaus and furnishers sometimes respond to consumer disputes with generic form letters that do not address the specific information provided. Each dispute must be investigated on its individual merits under 15 U.S.C. Section 1681i. A form response that does not address the specific violations cited in this letter does not constitute a compliant reinvestigation and may itself constitute a willful violation of the FCRA.

Should you fail to act in full compliance with the FCRA, I reserve the right to file formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and ${stateRef}, and to seek statutory and actual damages under 15 U.S.C. Sections 1681n and 1681o.
